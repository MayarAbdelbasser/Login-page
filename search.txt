Git revert:
    The git revert command can be considered an 'undo' type command, however, it is not a traditional undo operation.
    Instead of removing the commit from the project history, it figures out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and appends a new commit with the resulting inverse content.
    This prevents Git from losing history, which is important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration.
    Reverting should be used when you want to apply the inverse of a commit from your project history.
    This can be useful, for example, if youâ€™re tracking down a bug and find that it was introduced by a single commit. Instead of manually going in, fixing it, and committing a new snapshot, you can use git revert to automatically do all of this for you.

How to limit lines of text in CSS:
    The easiest way to limit text to n lines is to use line-clamp.
    N can be any positive number, but it will be two or three lines most of the time.
    *To truncate only one line we can use:
        .truncate {
        text-overflow: ellipsis;
        overflow: hidden;
        white-space: nowrap;
        }
    *Multiple lines truncation:
        .truncate {
        overflow: hidden;
        text-overflow: ellipsis;
        display: -webkit-box;
        -webkit-line-clamp: 2; /* number of lines to show */
        line-clamp: 2;
        -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
}
